Patch 1.6 Notes [2007-10-30]

Patch 1.6 contains new changed scripts and parameters so if you have made some changes in it you should
synchronize your scripts and parameters with changed files. 
If your mod contains any files updated by Update16.wd then you should release newer version of your mod,
otherwise your files will be overwritten by newer files from Update16.wd.
If you did changes only in graphics (all retexturing mods), your mod will still work in patch 1.6.


Scripts
In patch 1.6 more then half of all EarthC script files were changed less or more. Probably you didn't 
made any major changes in scripts so best way to keep modded scripts synchronized with 1.6 is to
copy your changes to new files and recompile it.


Parameters
If you did only small changes in parameters, you can copy your changes to new version of TwoWorlds.xls.
If you have more changes, than you can rather copy changed cells from new TwoWorlds.xls to your parameters file.

Quests
Few fixes in campaign quests has been make by WhizzEdit. If you didn't progress too much with your quests work,
you can do it again in TwoWorldsQuests.idx (Sorry there is no other way to synchronize it)


Network
Scripts for network were changed and now you don't need to modify Network\Levels.ech to add new network level.
Your lnd name should start with Net_. For every lnd file you must create *.txt file describing type
of your level. Take a look at Levels\*.txt files from Update16.wd to find out how to do that.
