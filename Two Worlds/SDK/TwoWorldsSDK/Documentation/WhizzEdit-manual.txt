2. Screen sections



Screen is divided into tree sections:
 A) Tree control - at the left
 B) Source view - at the top 
 C) Working area - in the middle



 A) Tree Control

 This section shows all items to be translated, grouped into folders. 
 To see item x in Source view and working area you must first select it in tree control.
 At the top of this section are buttons for loading and saving files and executing tools.


 B) Source view

 This section shows you the source version of a selected item. If an item has been changed
 or already translated, this window is where you can see its original texts.

 This window can be also used to compare your work with other language versions. 
 To do it open the [Source] combobox and choose a version which you want to be displayed in source view.


 C) Working area

 This is where you will spend most of the time - translating text.
 
 The Working area can work in one of the 3 display modes. 

 Directory mode - in this mode it displays only items in one directory - selected in A) Tree control.

 All mode - in this mode it displays all items from the file.

 Change modes by clicking on the small tab at the upper right corner of the Working Area. 
 This tab has  text 'All' or 'Dir' indicating current mode.

 The Search function allows you to search for texts, non translated items and updated items.

 Search function works only if you have an active Working area. It will not work in TreeControl or Source View.

 If you want to search in All file mode, switch to All mode.

  Search and replace function can be activated by Ctrl+H shortcut. 
  You have to be in working area to activate this shortcut.
  
  Search and replace function works in translated and original texts. 
  Anyway source won't be changed. Just copy with changed text will be created in txu file.

4.6 Search for Worlflow markers
   To search for texts with secific workflow markers you have to use word "State:" in search window before name of the marker.
   Examples:
      State:OK
      State:RP Draft
      State:Draft
       


======================================================================
5. File structure

 Whizz edit uses 2 kinds of files idx and txu.

 idx file is only ine and contains information about texts structure and source version of all texts.
 
 txu files are related to different languages. So there can be few txu files.
 txu file contains only translated texts and source version of those texts. Truring translation txu file grows longer and longer.


 We strongly suggest that you backup your txu file everyday. IF you lost idx file we can  send you a new one. But if you lost txu file - all your work is lost.


======================================================================
6. Updating txu files

 From time to time we will send you new idx file. This file will contain new texts and  probably some changes to the  old ones.
 You can simply  update your version by exchanging  old idx file with the new one in your working folder. 

 After loading new file in the program, new texts will be available. They will be marked as not translated. 

 More important are [updated] texts. Those are texts which were changed after you translated them. 
 You should  find them, take a look at the source and retranslate them. Mostly the cahnages are minor.


 You can find not translated and updated texts using the Search function see points 4.2 4.3


 Warning. When you change something in [updated] or [not translated] text, it will be displayed as normal text from this moment.
 Such text won't be searchable as [updated] or [not translated] anymore.
 So be careful!

 This behaviour will be changed in the next version.

======================================================================
7. Spellcheck

 To activate spellcheck click [Tools->] button, from drop down menu select [Spelling>]

15. Filtering COntent

available from version 1.9

To filter content, carry out following steps:

I. First make sure that the button [ALL] is activated (this button is in the upper right part of the screen, next to the search engine). Now you can see all the filtered items regardless of the catalog they are stored in.

II. Make sure that [FILTER] button is activated (pressed). This button is in the same row that [ALL] button. Now you see only the filtered items.

III. Customize the rules according to which the items are filtered. Press [HIGHLIGHT] button (it is located to the left to [FILTER] button) to call out an option window with several checkboxes and dialogs.

In the option window you just called out you see five rows you can customize. Every row of options allow you to set one rule. 
* In the first column you check if the rule is active. Possible options:
	- checked,
	- unchecked

* In the second column you choose what is the subject of the rule. Possible options:
	- ID		- helps filter by item ID
	- Name		- helps filter by item name
	- State		- helps filter by item state (like if it's 'OK', or 'not translated')
	- Translate	- helps filter by the words used
	- Word count	- helps filter by word count.

* In the third column you see the operators. They have meaning in the reference of the second and fourth column and link these colums in a logic statement. Every option from the second column has a separate list of Operators.

* In the fourth column you see the values. You may be prompted to type a value (i.e. in case of word count) or you will select from available options (i.e. 'draft' or 'not translated' or 'OK')


Now set the rules according to your needs. You can set up to 5 simultaneously, just remember of checking them with the checkbox in the first column.

When you ready, press [APPLY] and you shoudl see results. 
When you want to disable the filter, select [REMOVE] in the option window or unselect [FILTER] button.


Troubleshooting: 
________________

If you don't see any results, try to select any dialog line so you see it on the screen and then repeat the procedure. If you still have a problem, check if the [FILTER] button is pressed.


Example:
________

To see only items with Status not translated and the same time only those that DOES NOT include the word 'easy' and the same time with  the word count no lesser than 15 words set the following options:

Check first column with:	Status 		equals 			OK
Check second column with:	Translate	not contains		easy
Check second column with:	Word count 	is greater then		14

Now press [APPLY] and see the results.
