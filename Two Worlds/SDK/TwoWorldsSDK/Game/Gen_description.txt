How to generate random landscapes:

1. Prepare texture set where textures 1-5 are grasses or soils and texture no 13 is a road. 
2. Generate terrain from terrain generator (Type 2 works best).
3. Paint road with texture no 13.  No objercts will be generated on this texture.
4. Open console "C" key. And type @gen_forest#.txt  (in place of #  put number 1-7.
5. Close console and enjoy the map.
